To run the code. Simply use the make file by using the lines below:

"make"

Run the program by using:

"./myPaint [drawFlag] [additional parameters]"

The output image will be named corresponding to your parameter. And the timings of the parallel versus sequential solution will be written to the "Times.txt" file. We have included the baboon.ascii.pgm and balloons.ascii.pgm files as sample tests for you to use.

Use the following to clean the program:

"make clean"



If you would like, "seqMain.c" can be used to test only the sequential solution. The instructions to run the seqMain.c file is shown below:


Compile:
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -std=c11 seqMain.c seqPgmUtility.c -o seq.exe -lm
Circle:
    .\seq.exe -c 256 256 100 baboon.ascii.pgm baboon_c100_seq.pgm
Edge:
    .\seq.exe -e 50 baboon.ascii.pgm baboon_e50_seq.pgm
Line:
    .\seq.exe -l 1 5 300 300 baboon.ascii.pgm baboon_l1_seq.pgm


Lastly, is the gen_pgm.c file. It can be used to generate a large test pgm file.

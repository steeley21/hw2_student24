 *  @param[in,out]  header  holds the header of the pgm file in a 2D character array
 *                          After we process the pixels in the input image, we write the origianl 
 *                          header (or potentially modified) back to a new image file.
 *  @param[in,out]  numRows describes how many rows of pixels in the image.
 *  @param[in,out]  numCols describe how many pixels in one row in the image.
 *  @param[in]      in      FILE pointer, points to an opened image file that we like to read in.
 *  @return         If successful, return all pixels in the pgm image, which is an int *, equivalent to
